The Human Activity Recognition(HAR) model differentiates the different activities a human performs. It has very wide applications, such as in the field of healthcare to monitor the physical activity of patients, in the field of sports and fitness to analyze the activities of athletes to improve their performance, in security, and many more. In this study, you can see the pre-processing and EDA done on the HAR data set provided to us, before applying the model to classify the images into different classes
